# TI-84 Programs
This contains small TI-84 Programs I have written for my calculator, mostly for use in computer engineering classes.  Feel free to use these programs as you'd like.
## DELTAWYE
### Project Status: Complete
### Language: TI BASIC
In electronics, resistors can be organized in either delta-shaped or wye-shaped configurations.  Formulas exist to convert these numbers, but include enough fractions to be cumbersome to enter into a calculator.  This program takes a user's choice (delta to wye or wye to delta) and calculates the requested information based on subsequently inputted values.
## ACPOWER
