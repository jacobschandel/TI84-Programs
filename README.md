# TI-84 Programs
This contains small TI-84 Programs I have written for my calculator, mostly for use in computer engineering classes.  Feel free to use these programs as you'd like.
## DELTAWYE
### Project Status: Complete
### Language: TI BASIC
In electronics, resistors can be organized in either delta-shaped or wye-shaped configurations.  Formulas exist to convert these numbers, but include enough fractions to be cumbersome to enter into a calculator.  This program takes a user's choice (delta to wye or wye to delta) and calculates the requested information based on subsequently inputted values.
## ACPOWER
### Project Status: In Progress
### Language: TI BASIC
AC power involves a lot of complex numbers in polar form, and with it comes a mess of formulas.  This program accepts the r and theta values for the phasar voltage and current and returns the real, reactive, complex, and apparent powers as well as the power factor quickly.
## NUMCONVERT
### Project Status: In Progress
### Language: TI BASIC
This program is meant to convert unsigned numbers from one base to another (ex.: base 10 to base 2).
